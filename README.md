# ProjectMeiva
Just a fun little personal day tracking application in Python, Flask, GoLang, Jinja, and PowerShell

I believe in the right tool for the right job.

This is fully functional for me, not for others at this time. That is my long term goal, but hours in the day prevent it.
For now it is more a professional demonstration of code in github.

# Purpose
To demonstrate I am capable of cross language performance in code.
I want to write a Unity app in C#, a golang gui interface, a powershell subset.. this is meant to demonstrate many things
I want to leverage docker to stand up instances on the fly

# Currently Demonstrates
Python
Flask
Jinja
ElasticSearch
